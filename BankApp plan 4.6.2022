Plan:
Create a GUI design
Test Syntax a possible systems
Create a prototype
Refine prototype
Add extra features
Finish

Problems so far:
We have discovered an issue where action performed cannot read objects because it is a private method meaning we'd have to remake it every time. 
To rectify this issue we have an idea: Set the balance to text rather than text to balance.

We also have to consider how to get the correct name in, do we need a login page in that case?
How do we log everytime the button is pressed? Is this a priority?

Note: BankApp Java file should contain all our classes, it gets extended to every jFrame
