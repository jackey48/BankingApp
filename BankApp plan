Plan:
Create a GUI design
Test Syntax a possible systems
Create a prototype
Refine prototype
Add extra features
Finish

Problems so far:
How do we make the computer speed up for timeskip? (Don't have to, click a button, make it do a calculation, set the numbers, done)
We have discovered an issue where action performed cannot read objects because it is a private method meaning we'd have to remake it every time. 
To rectify this issue we have an idea: Set the balance to text rather than text to balance. (Turns out it COULD read objects, we were just putting them in the wrong place)

We also have to consider how to get the correct name in, do we need a login page in that case?
How do we log everytime the button is pressed? Is this a priority? (Never ended up doing that)

Possibly improve the GUI at some point (Matthew got it)

Fix all these error with savings.form (Matthew got it, fixed the class and the constructor)

The codes getting pretty messy (Added: checkDebt, withdrawl, round, and AddLoan methods)

Note: BankApp Java file should contain all our classes, it gets extended to every jFrame

Discoveries:
Turns out you can put objects inside the GUI class
System.exit(0) kills both windows
Netbeans will sometimes not notice when errors occur and are fixed, running it updates that most of the time
Rename your variables, trying to sort out what jbuttons 1-5 are takes too long
